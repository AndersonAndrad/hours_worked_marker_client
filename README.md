# Personal ERP client

## Why I create this project

I have created a system to help me with every day challenges, such as managing my time, tracking my work hours, and keeping control of my finance.

## Observations

- I've designed this system for me personal use, and any rules can be adjusted to suit your needs. Feel free to make changes without the need for opening a pull request.
- I will make updates to any rule as needed to meet my requirements. any part of the code system can be change without prior communication.

## Future releases
